# Forschungspraxis: VAE-Based Indoor Localization

## Introduction

This project applies a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for fingerprinting-based indoor localization, focusing on using the latent representation of the signal's multipath component for the localization task. The goal is to achieve accurate indoor positioning by analyzing the complex behavior of signal propagation within closed environments.

## Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets of different indoor localization scenarios.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and classes.
- `vae_models/`: VAE Implementations and loss definitions.
- `trained_models/`: Contains weights and input dimensions of trained models for evaluation.
