# VAE-based Indoor Localization

### Introduction

This project applies a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for fingerprinting-based indoor localization, focusing on using the latent representation of the signal's multipath components for the localization task. The goal is to achieve accurate indoor positioning using the complex behaviour of propagating EM signals in indoor environments.

### Repository Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets of different indoor localization scenarios.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and classes.
- `vae_models/`: VAE Implementations and loss definitions.
- `trained_models/`: Contains weights and input dimensions of trained models for evaluation.
